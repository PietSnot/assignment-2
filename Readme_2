============

The file 'cachematrix.R' consists of three parts.

part 1 
simply stated the two functions given as example: makeVector and cachemean.
I put them in to easily copy then to part 2

part 2
contains the two functions that we have to make: makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve.
These are the two fuctions to be peer reviewed.

part 3
is pure hobbyism of me. I was not pleased with the two functions, both of part 1 
and of part 2. I tried to design a set up that would eliminate the 'makeXXX'
for the user, and secondly to generalize the cahceXXX object somewhat.
So, istead of cacheMean, cacheSolve, cahceWhatEver, there is now only one object
cacheGeneralVlue, that can be used for sevral functions.
If the peer reviewer is interested: by all means, have a look. If not, then
he/she can safely skip this part and move on to the nexr review.
